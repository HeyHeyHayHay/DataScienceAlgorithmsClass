# Data Science Algorithms: Implementation and Applications

This repository contains implementations of various data science algorithms based on a course that introduces both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of key concepts in the field. The course provides an in-depth exploration of different algorithms in data science, with a focus on clustering, regression, dimension reduction, and manifold learning.

## Current Implementations:

This repository currently includes implementations of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm and the **Kernel Density Estimation** (KDE) algorithm.

###K-Means Clustering

I wrote a K-Means clustering algorithm in Python to simplify an image by reducing it to a set of k dominant colors. Below are some examples:

I also used K-Means clustering algorithm to classify animal taxon.

###Kernel Density Estimation

I implemented a **Kernel Density Estimation** (KDE) algorithm for various kernels in OpenGL Shading Language on ShaderToy. Using KDE, I created a generative artwork:
