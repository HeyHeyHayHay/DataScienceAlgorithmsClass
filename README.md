# Data Science Algorithms: Implementation and Applications

This repository contains implementations of various data science algorithms based on a course that introduces both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of key concepts in the field. The course provides an in-depth exploration of different algorithms in data science, with a focus on clustering, regression, dimension reduction, and manifold learning.

### Current Implementation: K-Means Clustering
As of now, this repository includes the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.
